Perch Bootstrap
===============

Perch Bootstrap is a super basic framework to use as a starting point when building a website using [Perch CMS][perch]. It includes all the stuff I find myself duplicating for each new project.

+ CSS Reset
+ A collection of very basic SASS classes and mixins
+ Grunt configuration to watch, compile and minify JS/SASS

Setup
-----

```
$ git clone git@github.com:samhicks/Perch-Bootstrap.git
```

Here's a great article on getting setup with [Grunt][grunt].

I've done the hard work for you, so once you've installed Node it's basically a simple case of navigating to your project folder in terminal and running the following commands:

```
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
grunt
```

Other than that you just need to purchase a [Perch licence][perch], download the latest version of the CMS and follow [these instructions][perchsetup] to get it working locally.
